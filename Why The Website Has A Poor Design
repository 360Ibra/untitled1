1. Poor photography for the pictures very bad angles taken of the cakes overall image quality is not the best aswell
Solution - Fixed this by downloading images and editing them together with Adobe to give them a better designed look
I then used filter to increase the saturation to add a rich colour to the cakes image.

2.Corporate Events They had alot of big brand companies that they have worked
with but instead of dispaying it in the home page to attract more customers instantly
it was in a different webpage First impression is everything a user may click off a website very fast if nothing
on the home page interests them I felt it was better to put the brands in the homepage to build a sense of trust
with the customer.

3.Navigation bar

The navigation bar was just very unclear it had small font and alot of navbar items which is just alot of words
being thrown at the user


4.Footer

The footer had a very large whitespace that looked very unattractive so I created a new footer which
also has links to their social media which is not included in their website

5.Homepage

Navigating to the homepage is not easy so I implemented the logo and a home nav-item on the nav bar which allows user to access
the home page easily as the navbar follows as user scrolls downwards.

The design I used was a bootstrap
